1
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,953
Alarm goes off Ring ring a ling

2
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,220
Whenever our eyes meet

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,522
I notice but just spin around

4
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:28,814
Yet I keep getting closer I know it’s too late

5
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:31,814
In my heart I already know

6
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:35,133
Sooner or later I’ll step over the line

7
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,777
I’m warning myself

8
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,348
You shouldn’t be doing this

9
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,917

10
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,569
Out of control

11
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,824
I’m surrounded by that Spot spot spotlight

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,079
As it shines on me, I’m swept into the darkness

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,172
I see the end, I know it’s not right

14
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:55,392
I can’t stop me, can’t stop me

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:58,707
Right in front of me, this Red red red line

16
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,960
Across from each other, you and I exchange glances

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,946
Wanna feel the thrilling Highlight

18
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:07,850

Is impossible, I fall deeper into darkness
