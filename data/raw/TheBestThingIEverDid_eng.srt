1
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:12,491
The best thing I ever did

2
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:26,951
December, as we end the year together, I remember

3
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:31,301
Our memories pile up like the snow

4
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:36,401
So many words I saved for you linger in my mind

5
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,223
Makes me nervous

6
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:42,913
Used to feel lonely and empty

7
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:47,880
But December is no longer lonely

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,493
The best thing I ever did

9
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:56,923
Was that I met you

10
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,393
The best thing I never did

11
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:06,123
Was that I never broke up with you, 
and that I am still with you

12
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:10,443
All I wanna do All I wanna do

13
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:15,233
Just like this, like this, like this, like this, 
the two of us forever

14
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:19,583
All I wanna do All I wanna do

15
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:24,811
Just like this, like this, like this, like this, 
let us never change

16
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:30,363
Though I don’t notice, it just keeps showing

17
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:36,143
My friends are teasing that 
I’m smiling from ear to ear the whole day

18
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,353
Even when I’m alone, I feel as if

19
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,653
You are behind me, my ears keep getting red

20
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,355
I can’t help it, I keep thinking of you

21
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:49,325
Used to feel lonely and empty

22
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:53,925
But December is no longer lonely

23
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:56,935
The best thing I ever did

24
00:01:56,935 --> 00:02:03,155
Was that I met you

25
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:07,755
The best thing I never did

26
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:13,415
Was that I never broke up with you, 
and that I am still with you

27
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,675
As the year goes by, Little by little

28
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,867
So many things have happened

29
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:21,965
But when I think about what they meant

30
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:26,815
Why are they the moments I spent with you

31
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:31,167
I think I might be in love

32
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,457
The best thing I ever did

33
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:39,727
Was that I met you

34
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:44,307
The best thing I never did

35
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:49,037
Was that I never broke up with you, 
and that I am still with you

36
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:53,317
All I wanna do All I wanna do

37
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:58,277
Just like this, like this, like this, like this, 
the two of us forever

38
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:02,507
All I wanna do All I wanna do

39
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:07,799
Just like this, like this, like this, like this, 
let us never change

40
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:17,303
The best thing I ever did

41
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:28,535
The best thing I ever did
