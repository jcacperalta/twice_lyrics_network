1
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,108
People just can’t leave me alone

Everyone is staring at me oh

9
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:30,602
Some people ask “who’s your mama?”

10
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:32,231
They take a fresh approach

11
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:34,015
But I don’t feel a thing

12
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:37,449

00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,785
Wherever I go, I go without makeup

33
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:33,180
But I’m the one who shines the most

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,464
Flat shoes can’t hide my high value
