00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,520
Keep wanting to show it all again and again

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,020
 

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,940
Every single little thing

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Inside the small screen.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,600
I wanna be the prettiest

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,940
Yet still I hide my feelings deep inside

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,280
It takes so much effort to get the perfect look

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,840
But it is something I can never give up

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Makes my heart beat everyday,

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,620
It's something you must never know

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Then I go on pretending

22
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,460
Bb cream pa-pa-pa,

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
Put on some lipstick mam-mam-ma

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,780
Pose for the camera, aren't I pretty?

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,520
When you see this,

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
make a smile,

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,820
and press hard

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,400
On that cute red  (Heart Heart) down there

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,740
Like is such a common word,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,100
not enough to express my feelings.

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,260
But I like it,

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,040

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,100

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,140
I hold my breath to pull up the zipper,

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,780
tighten the waist again

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,080

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,120
and press hard

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,280
On the cute red (Heart Heart) down there

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,640
Like is such a common word,

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,080
not enough to express my feelings

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,220

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,900
Don't wanna hide it anymore

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
I feel melancholy today,

62
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,080
pretend im not, but I still feel sad

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sulking cuz' you're not responding

64
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,840
