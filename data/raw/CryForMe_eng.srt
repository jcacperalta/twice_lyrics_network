1
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:18,204
I know there’s no point trying to change you

2
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,542
But unlike her, I am

3
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:25,650
not about to let go so easy (Never let go)

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,888
You don't know me

5
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:32,316
L O V E or hatred

6
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:35,387
Instead of goodbye I wear an innocent smile

7
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:39,823
Today I wanna be in your arms again

8
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:41,458
As if I don’t know anything

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,140
Baby no more real love

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,759
I will stay by your side

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,702
Then in the end break your heart

12
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:48,398
Bad boy bad boy

13
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,609

14
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:53,764

15
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:56,999

20
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,161
Little by little I fall for you

21
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:12,806
Love makes my mind give way

22
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,219
And I keep making reasons to forgive

23
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,326

24
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:17,916

Cry for me

27
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,507
I don't know but I just can’t seem to hate you

28
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:31,631
Always defending you in front of my friends

29
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:35,954
Made a fool of myself

30
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:40,495
Why do you keep smiling at me

31
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:43,850
Just one tear is all it takes

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,231
Cry for me, let me please forgive you

33
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,890
As if I don’t know anything

Love is so toxic

53
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:36,290
It makes hatred melt away
