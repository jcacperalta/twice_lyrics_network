1
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,911
Phone bell rings like every other day

2
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:26,866
Please give me a break

3
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:29,149
My battery’s running out

4
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:31,897
It keeps ringing and ringing

5
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:34,726
The phone might blow up any minute

6
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:37,143
He says I take his breath away

7
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:38,501
I get him all frustrated

8
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,104
I make his heart race why

9
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:43,530
He says I’m so pretty

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,059
Not that I’m bragging or anything

11
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,209
Oh, sorry for not answering

12
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:52,068
I was with my friend shy shy shy

13
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:54,740
Can’t see you right now, I’m sorry

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,016
I’ll call you later

15
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,629
Don’t urge me, it won’t take long

16
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,343
And I’ll let you call me baby

17
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:05,175
Now is not the time, it is too early

18
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,848
But show me a bit more

19
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,317
CHEER UP BABY

20
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,746
CHEER UP BABY

21
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:12,958
Give it a little more

22
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,913
A girl shouldn’t give her heart away so easily

23
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:19,162
That will make you want me more

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:24,050
I’ll pretend like I don’t care

25
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,032
So you don’t notice my feelings for you

26
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,473
just get it together and then baby

27
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:30,417
CHEER UP

28
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,382
I can just hear your anxious voice

29
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:37,094
I can just see your phone covered in sweat

30
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:39,983
Answering right away is no fun

31
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,711
I read your messages but ignore your calls

32
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,500
Uhh maybe I went too far boy

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,240
Worried I might tire out your patience

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,988
Uhh, but if I don’t, I might

35
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:53,623
Fall for you deeper, fall for you deeper

36
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,889
Oh, sorry I didn’t reply

37
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,602
I was with my friend shy shy shy

38
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,753
Can’t see you right now, I’m sorry

39
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,882
I’ll call you later

40
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:07,641
Don’t urge me, I’m not going anywhere

41
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,339
I will be your baby

42
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,242
Don’t be hasty, show some sincerity

43
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,917
I will wait for you

44
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,373
CHEER UP BABY

45
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:18,784

46
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:20,998

47
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:23,845
A girl shouldn’t give her heart away so easily

48
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,091
That will make you want me more

49
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:32,055
I’ll pretend like I don’t care

50
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:35,008
So you don’t notice my feelings for you

51
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,474
just get it together and then baby

00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,248
CHEER UP

53
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:43,150
I like you too, I’m afraid I might hurt you

54
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:51,739
But I hope you understand, I’m a girl after all

55
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,430
I’m afraid my feelings might show

56
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,202
Just come a little closer

57
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:59,004
