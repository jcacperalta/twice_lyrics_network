1
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,170
The door closes at twelve

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,894
Please hurry up a bit

3
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:21,655
Knock knock knock knock, knock on my door

4
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,333
At night inside my mind

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,500
The door opens up

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,160
I need somebody
(Someone else!)

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,750
You keep lingering around

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,634
Taking a sneak peek

9
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:36,480
Knock knock knock knock, knock on my door

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,390
Probably another playboy

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,999
Obviously just a bad boy

12
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:43,739
I need some assurance 
(Knock knock!)

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,769

No need for that gold key or get lucky

25
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,793
If you truly mean it everything’s gonna be okay

26
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:22,523
Oh no, you’re already here, could you please wait a moment

27
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,523
You pop in when I am alone

28
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:26,425
Shake me right out of my mind

29
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:30,125
Now is the perfect show time

30
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,063

My frozen heart will, my my heart will

48
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,194
Melt away like an ice cream

49
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:00,594
